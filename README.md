# techlaw.tech
the techlaw homepage. Runs on Jekyll and Minima using Github pages actions.

If I commit to main, the website changes after a minute or two.

Documentation for minima is [here](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). 

 - the big idea is: anything in `_docs/_*` overwrites the defailt file in the `minima` repo.

 - Posts must be of the form `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title-with-hyphens` to show up.
